An episode: the resulting trajectory from start to terminal state is called an episode of trial. 

terminal states as: - absorbing states; reduce the action space at that terminal state
			- normal state; but give a reward for staying in it
			
			
			
So basically the idea of the bidding model:
- learn the optimal bid to make in function of the number of cards, based on learned games we can come up with a number: for 2 cards upto 8 cards. 

--> I believe Rikiki is a stationary problem, the rules do not evolve over time. 

The reward depends on: R(s,a) and s'. But since s' depends on s, a we can rewrite it like that. 


--> Using the founded model information we will use this optimal bid, and learn the AI to play accordingly to win. 
Summarised: we want to learn the AI to win when needed, and lose when needed. 

If I can show that my model, given a hand of cards is able to play to lose and to win, we can conclude that the model learned how to play well.
